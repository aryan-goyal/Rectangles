# Rectangles
Analyze rectangles and features that exist among rectangles.

## Development

The solution was developed in Python. The visualizations are created using the Matplotlib library. 

## Usage

## Testing

## Local Setup

- On Linux or macOS, run `source setup.sh`. This will create a python virtual environment with the packages required to execute the application.

- If there is an issue related to packaging dependency, then the `pip3 -r requirements.txt` can be used to install the same package version used for development.
